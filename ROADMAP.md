# Roadmap – Open VALR

## 🎯 Vision

To provide well-tested, community-maintained SDKs for the VALR Exchange API,
enabling developers worldwide to interact with VALR
more easily across multiple languages.

---

## 📋 Current Phase

### Phase 0: OpenAPI Specification (Current Focus)

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive, accurate OpenAPI specification for VALR's API.

Before building any SDKs, the primary objective is to:

- Document all VALR API endpoints in OpenAPI 3.0 format
- Define request/response schemas accurately
- Include authentication methods and security schemes
- Ensure the specification is complete and validated

The OpenAPI specification will serve as the foundation for all future SDK generation.

<!-- **Status:** 🚧 In Progress

See [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml) for the current specification. -->
